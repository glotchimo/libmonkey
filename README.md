# sus

A programming language inspired by the popular "Among Us" game.

## Why?

To learn parser/compiler/language theory basics on stream.

## Things to note

Because it is Among Us-themed, there are some non-conventional keywords (i.e. "let" being "vote" and "goto" being "vent").

## Todo

-   Fully implement memory management for existing structures
-   Implement a sufficient linked-list for use in the AST
-   Implement a sufficient hash-map for use in the environment
